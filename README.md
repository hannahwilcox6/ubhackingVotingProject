This project was written using Python 3.7, Pycharm IDE, and the pygame library. Any and all code was written starting after the hackathon 12:00 PM start time.
Collaborators include: Hannah Wilcox, Brodie Lembo, and Katherine Stock (ideas and visual assets, thus why she is not seen as a collaborator in this repository)

PyGame Rules:
  Press 'E' for interaction between the NPCs and the Ballot Box. Use 'A' and 'D' to move left and right respectively.
  Press 'A' 'B' 'C' 'D' to answer quiz questions from NPCs.
  You must interact with all three NPCs and answer their quizzes about various information regarding the upcoming presidential election. Once you
  complete this task you may then go to the ballot box at the right side of the map and interact with it to vote, and end the game!
  
This game was made with the idea of spreading voting awareness through an interactive game, and also informing players about various voting information (specific to New York State)
in the hopes of inspiring them to vote and get involved with their local election proceess.

We hope you enjoy our game :) it was a lot of fun to make, especially as our first time using PyCharm, and Brodie and Katherine's first time at a hackathon.
